# Enron Fraud Detection

The purpose of this work is to detect if the person is involved in the scadal in Enron using their email and financial dataset. 

**Background** 

Enron was a giant company in the U.S., named as one of the most innovative companies, collapsed in several months after its financial fraud was uncovered. The collapse affected the lives of thousands of employees and shook Wall Street to its core, and lead to the bankrupcy of formerly one of the "Big Five" Arthur Andersen(now known as Accenture), who was handling the audit of Enron.

# Version for Python 2 or Python 3:
The original code was writen in Python2, and the prediction was quite successful. However since the Python environment has been updated to Python 3 and some libraries have also been updated, there are some codes need to be modified as well. So far the Python 2 version is running well, there are still bugs in Python 3 version, which shall be finished soon.
